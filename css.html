        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web language used to style web pages.
            It is added to a web page by linking a CSS file using the "link" tag.
            Every web page on this site contains the following tag: <span class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                href="style.css"&gt;</span>.
            It tells the browser to load the <span class="code">style.css</span> file and apply it to this web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <span class="emphasis">CSS Rule</span> is some CSS code that is only applied to certain HTML tags.
            <br>
            A <span class="emphasis">CSS Selector</span> determines which tags a rule is applied to.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            If an element is targeted by several rules, the rules will be merged.
            If the rules conflict, more specific rules will override less specific rules.
            A rule that makes all text blue will be overridden by a rule that makes a
            specific paragraph black.
            A rule that makes text bold will merge with a rule that makes a specific paragraph red.
        </p>
