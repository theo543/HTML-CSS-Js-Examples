# HTML-CSS-Js-Examples
A website I made to improve my knowledge of web programming and modern web development tools.
# Description
This is a static website containing documentation of the tools and code used to build it and scripts that perform functions such as highlighting HTML elements, toggling CSS and adding MDN reference links. It was built from an old school project which can be viewed from a dialog in the site. It is written in Pug, SCSS and TypeScript, built with Gulp and Webpack and hosted on GitHub Pages.
# Installation
