                span.
                    I made the first version of this website in 2019 for a school project about HTML and CSS.
                    The original version had all sorts of issues - ugly colors and gradients,
                    faking buttons with CSS, strange fonts, no dark theme, etc.
                br
                span I decided to redesign it to learn more about web development tools and concepts, such as:
                ul
                    li Cross-browser compatibility
                    li Build automation
                    li Accessibility
                    li Preprocessors / Transpiled Languages
                    li Postprocessors
                    li Polyfills
                    li Node.js and npm
                    li CSS quirks
            p I ended up pretty much rewriting it from scratch. Check out the dialog on the left side to see the original website!
