            h1.text-center Web Development Tools
            br
            p There are many tools used to speed up and simplify software development. This page lists the tools used to make this website.
            h2 #[a(href="https://git-scm.com/") Git - Source Control]
            p.
                Source control is the tracking and managing of changes to source code files.
                The most popular source control program used as of today is #[span.emphasis Git].
                Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that no central server is necessary to
                use Git. At the software level, there is no difference between the Git data stored on a server and on
                a developer's computer. Uploading (#[span.emphasis 'pushing']) is not required to save edits (#[span.emphasis 'commits']).
                This allows the user to use Git while offline. Additionally, two users
                editing the same code will not encounter any errors until they attempt to push their commit
                to the server (repository/#[span.emphasis 'repo']), at which point it is easy to resolve
                conflicts between the two commits. Each commit is linked to one or more commits which are
                the previous versions of the repository.
            p.
                Git allows for easy development using multiple branches of a project. The default
                branch (main/master) is generally used for the latest project version which is available to users.
                Often, another branch is used while working on the next version of the project, which is merged
                into the main branch after it is done.
                New branches can be created from any commit and can be merged into any branch.
                It is possible to merge branches without deleting either. For example, if an urgent change
                is made directly to main, because it cannot wait for the next version to be finished,
                merging main into the development branch will not delete or modify main.
                (Merging branch main into dev will update dev with the changes from main.
                Merging dev into main will update main. Only the currently loaded branch is modified.)
            h2 Transpiled Languages
            p.
                Many languages used in web development are not processed directly by a web browser or server.
                Instead, they are compiled into HTML, CSS or JavaScript. A transpiler is a compiler that
                converts code between human-readable languages, unlike compilers which convert code
                into executable files.
            p.
                There are no files with the ".css", ".js" and ".html" extensions in the
                #[a(href="https://github.com/theo543/HTML-CSS-Js-Examples/tree/main/src") source files] for
                this website. Instead, ".scss", ".ts" and ".pug" files are transpiled into the standard languages
                at build time.
            h3 #[a(href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/") TypeScript]
            p.
                TypeScript is a strongly typed version of JavaScript. In JavaScript, you can store
                any kind of data in a variable. In TypeScript, you declare what kind of data
                can be stored in each variable. This prevents errors such as using the text "false"
                instead of the boolean false value when calling a function i.e. #[span.code element.classList.toggle("blue", "false")]
                would #[em enable] the "blue" class, because any non-empty string is converted to true.
                TypeScript would detect the error, and editor integration would highlight it even before
                compilation. Compilation erases type information, since JavaScript does not support
                such features, so TypeScript cannot prevent errors at runtime, but type-related errors
                can be found at compile-time if variables are not declared with overly-general types or
                using the 'any' type.
            h3 #[a(href="https://sass-lang.com/") SCSS]
            p.
                SCSS is a #[span.emphasis superset] of CSS (any CSS is valid SCSS) which adds better syntax
                for reusing code, mostly nested rules. For example:
            p.code.
                #password-change-window {
                    font-weight: bold;
                    button {
                        background-color: red;
                    }
                    input[type='text'] {
                        background-color: orange;
                    }
                }
            p.
                This is converted to three CSS rules. If this was written directly in CSS, you would need
                to manually repeat the ID. When changing an ID or class name in CSS, it is much more likely
                to forget to update something than in SCSS. SCSS also allows defining blocks of code ("mixins") that
                can then be reused using include statements:
            p.code.
                @mixin breakpoint($type) {
                    @if $type == mobile {
                        @media (max-width: $mobile-width) {
                            @content;
                        }
                    } @else if $type == desktop {
                        @media not all and (max-width: $mobile-width) {
                            @content;
                        }
                    }
                }
            br
            p.code.
                nav {
                    @include breakpoint(desktop) {
                        max-width: 60%;
                    }
                    background-color: yellow;
                }
            p.
                This is used to write CSS that only applies to mobile or desktop based on screen width.
            h3 #[a(href="https://pugjs.org/") Pug]
            p.
                Pug is a templating engine, which can also be compiled at build-time.
                It can be used to dynamically generate HTML based on the user's request.
                Pug code is similar to HTML; It uses indentation instead of { brackets,
                has shortcuts for the class and ID attributes, and other syntax shortcuts for common purposes. Example:
            p.code.
                #main-section This will become a div with the ID main-section!
                    p.center-text.blue: strong.
                        Welcome to the website!
                        This text has the center-text and blue classes and is
                        bolded by the &lt;strong&gt; tag!
                    p.
                        #{'Click #[a(href="https://google.com") here] to open Google!'}
                        This paragraph has a link tag in it!
                    p(style="white-space:pre;").
                        The first two paragraphs will display as one line,
                        because line breaks and whitespace are limited
                        to one space by default. However, this
                        paragraph will still be five lines in the browser.
                        This  line  will  keep  the  double  spaces.
            p.
                It also supports mixins, similar to SCSS, which is the main reason I used it for this website.
                The &lt;head&gt; tag, links section, and page div are all defined in mixins. This means that if
                a script needs to be added to each page from the header, only one file needs to be changed.
                Additionally, Pug allows JavaScript code to run when compiling. For example,
                the bolded link in this page is automatically detected using code which checks if the
                link target equals the name of the file being compiled. The popup to visit
                the original website does not appear here because this webpage has no original version;
                This is not detected in JavaScript but in Pug, the script simply checks if the window
                exists and enhances it if it does.
            h2 #[a(href="https://babeljs.io/") Babel]
            p.
                Babel is a tool used to transform JavaScript code based on plugins.
                This website is compiled using a standard plugin preset for compatibility which rewrites
                code to be more compatible with old browsers.
                Automatically includes necessary core-js features.
            h2 #[a(href="https://postcss.org/") PostCSS]
            p.
                Similar to Babel, uses plugins to transform CSS. This website uses a compatibility
                plugin which adds prefixes to properties (i.e. -moz-box-sizing for Firefox).
                Usually, browsers use prefixes when first implementing experimental additions to the CSS
                standards, and remove the prefix once the feature is finalized. On up-to-date browsers
                the prefixed properties do nothing, but on old browsers they are needed. It also uses
                a plugin that minimized file size.
            h2 #[a(href="https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier") html-minifier]
            p A standalone tool that minimizes HTML file sizes.
            h2 #[a(href="https://browsersync.io/") Browsersync]
            p.
                A testing tools which creates a local server that refreshes the browser
                automatically when a file is modified.
            h2 #[a(href="https://www.npmjs.com/") npm]
            p.
                Npm is the package manager used by Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime that runs
                JavaScript on the server. This website is static and does not use server-side scripts,
                however npm is also used to install packages used only for development written in Node.js JavaScript.
                Every other tool is installed and managed through npm.
            h2 #[a(href="https://gulpjs.com/") Gulp]
            p.
                A build automation tool. Executes tasks defined using Node.js JavaScript and provides
                tools for passing files between different programs using plugins. For example,
                the Pug task first takes all files that do not start with "_" (the "_mixins.pug" file is the only one that does),
                renames the extension to ".html", uses a plugin to expose the file name to the Pug compiler
                (used for the bolded link), compiles the files, passes them to html-minifier, then writes
                them to the output folder. Another task runs a series of commands that copies the first Git
                commit to a subfolder named "original". Gulp allows for serial and parallel tasks.
            p.
                The 'build' task, for example, generates the compiled website, however the default
                task runs 'build', then also opens the output with Browsersync and watches files for changes.
                The 'build' tasks first deletes previous compiled output, then runs several compiling tasks
                simultaneously. Gulp will detect when all 'build' tasks are done, then the default task starts a Browsersync
                test server and then a watch task that runs indefinitely. The watch task calls
                'build' again whenever the project is edited and refreshes Browsersync after 'build' is done.
            h2 #[a(href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stream") Webpack]
            p.
                Used to bundle JavaScript code into a website's #[span.emphasis entry points], meaning the JavaScript files referenced
                directly from script tags. This allows splitting long files into many files which will be merged into
                the entry points, however it also allows using npm modules in client-side code,
                such as the core-js include statements generated by babel which refer to a local module.
                Webpack merges the module into the script files, extracts shared code into "shared.js" to avoid duplicating
                core-js for each file, removes unused code and minimized the generated files.
            p.
                Webpack can be used to process any kind of file when using the correct plugins, such as HTML files,
                TypeScript, assets such as images, CSS etc. Although this project only uses Webpack for core-js,
                many projects use Webpack without Gulp, since it supports complex functions such as compiling TypeScript,
                minimizing file size for CSS and HTML, optimizing image files, etc.
                However, it cannot perform tasks such as exporting the original version of this website from Git,
                since Webpack can only transform already existing files.
            h2 #[a(href="https://github.com/features/actions") GitHub Actions]
            p A build and test tool that runs code when a commit is pushed to a GitHub repo. Used to run 'build' with Gulp and commit the result to another branch.
            h2 #[a(href="https://pages.github.com/") GitHub Pages]
            p.
                A free hosting service provided by GitHub. Updates automatically when the built website is pushed to the
                #[a(href="https://github.com/theo543/HTML-CSS-Js-Examples/tree/pages/docs") 'pages'] branch by GitHub Actions.
