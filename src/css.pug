                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web language used to style web pages.
                It is added to a web page by linking a CSS file using the "link" tag.
                Every web page on this site contains the following tag:
                #[span.code &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;].
                It tells the browser to load the #[span.code style.css] file and apply it to this web page.
            p.
                A #[span.emphasis CSS Rule] is some CSS code that is only applied to certain HTML tags.
                #[br]
                A #[span.emphasis CSS Selector] determines which tags a rule is applied to.
                #[br]
            p.
                If an element is targeted by several rules, the rules will be merged.
                If the rules conflict, more specific rules will override less specific rules.
                A rule that makes all text blue will be overridden by a rule that makes a
                specific paragraph black.
                A rule that makes text bold will merge with a rule that makes a specific paragraph red.
